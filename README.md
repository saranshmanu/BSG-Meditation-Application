# BSG-Meditation-Application

- this app is meant for educational purposes only -

Trailblazerr allows you to keep a track of your Daimoku. It shows you the duration of Daimoku you did today and the day before. 

It provides a clean interface to allow all BSG followers to chant without any internet connection. The chant, Nam Myoho Renge Kyo is already in built in the app. 

Note - We do not own the music recording used. We do not intend to use this for commercial purposes. This app is to assist people who want to follow Nicherin Buddhism.
